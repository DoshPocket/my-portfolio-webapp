# my-portfolio-webapp

## Description
I built this project to help break into the web development industry. While building this web app, I learned both HTML and CSS in more detail and was able to create a reasonably polished first draft of the web app that will blow away any potential employers who decide to take a minute to peruse it. I am now one step closer to being fully prepared to launch my job search at the end of my boot camp.
